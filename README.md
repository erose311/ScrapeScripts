# Data Scraping Tools

This repository contains code snippets for various data scraping tasks.

- PitchBookParser: Scrap data by parsing the html file manually downloaded from the PitchBook website. This provides a free alternative to PitchBook's premium account. 
- YouTubeAudio: This script uses the Pytube library to scrape audio from a list of YouTube links, and then converts the scraped mp4 files to WAV format using FFmpeg. 
This makes the final output suitable for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks.
